# ⏰ Time Conversion Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The Time Conversion Project is a simple C programming based mini project designed to convert time from one format to another. This project helps beginners understand basic C programming concepts such as variables, conditional statements, switch case, and arithmetic operations through a real-world problem.

## 🎯 Why This Project?
The main purpose of creating this project is to give students hands-on practice with logical problem solving using C language. Time conversion is a common and practical problem, making this project useful for college practical exams, mini projects, and viva preparation.

## 🔄 Features
This project supports the following time conversions:
1. Convert Seconds to Hours : Minutes : Seconds  
2. Convert Hours : Minutes : Seconds to Total Seconds  
3. Convert Minutes to Hours and Minutes  
4. Convert 12-Hour Format to 24-Hour Format  

## 🛠️ Utility
This project is useful for:
- College assignments and practical examinations  
- Beginners learning C programming  
- Solving time calculation related problems  
- Improving logical thinking and problem-solving skills  

## 💻 Technologies Used
Programming Language: C  
Compiler: GCC  
Platform: Windows / Linux
